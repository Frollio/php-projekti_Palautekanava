# RV Palautekanava (RV Feedback Channel)

Palautekanava was my first project in Web Programming education. It is clumsy, needs refactoring and lacks some parts of the authentication. Still, it functions after manually inserting admin information to the database.

## About language

The variables and the content of RV Palautekanava are mostly in Finnish.

## About content and Repovesi National Park

"RV" is short for "Repoveden kansallispuisto" ("Repovesi National Park") which is a real national park in Finland. Please notice that I only used the park as dummy content. This application is not really related to the Repovesi National Park.

## Live Demo
